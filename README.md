SharpGMad
=========

SharpGMad is a reimplementation of Garry Newman's 
[GMad](http://github.com/garrynewman/gmad) application.

The original piece of software is used to manipulate Garry's Mod (his
game) addon files and is written in C++. SharpGMod takes it to
availability in C# by being written directly from the code available by
garry. This also includes reimplementing (partially) his
[bootil](http://github.com/garrynewman/bootil) library.
